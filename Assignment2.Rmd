#Project Description

This project uses ToothGrowth data. The dataset has three columns, namely, *len*, *supp*, and *dose*. *len* represents the length of tooth while *supp* denotes the supplements treated to the sample. *dose* represents the different dose given in the experiment.

##Load ToothGrowth dataset and some basic exploratory data analyses.

***First 10 rows in ToothGrowth dataset***

```{r}
head(ToothGrowth,10)
```

***Summary of ToothGrowth dataset***
```{r}
summary(ToothGrowth)
```

***Comparison of the mean for tooth length based on two types of supplements***

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)

dt<-data.table(ToothGrowth)
dt.mean <- dt[,mean(len),by=supp]
ggplot(dt.mean,aes(x=supp, y=V1,fill=supp)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") + labs(x="Supplement",y="Mean", title="Comparison of mean for two supplements", fill="Supplement") + theme_bw()
 
```

##t-test for comparing two different types of supplements on growth length

The assumption is that the supplements are independent of each other.
The formula has **len~supp** because len is numeric while supp is factor.

```{r}
t.test(len ~ supp, data = ToothGrowth)
```

**Conclusion**   
p-value > 0.05, therefore suggesting that there is no statistically significant difference in ***len*** given the two different groups OJ and VC.

##t-test for comparing different types of doses on growth length

This type of t-test is independent 2-group t-test, with the assumption that two types of doses have no relation or dependency between them.
```{r}
t.test(ToothGrowth$len,ToothGrowth$dose)
```

**Conclusion**     
p-value < 0.05, therefore suggesting that is a statistically significant difference between the types of doses in growth length.
